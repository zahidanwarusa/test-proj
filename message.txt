Dear [Manager’s Name],

I hope you’re doing well. I’m writing to formally resign from my position as a Software Engineer supporting CBP, effective [your last working day, typically two weeks from the date of the email, unless otherwise specified in your contract].

I’ve appreciated the opportunity to contribute to the team and gain valuable experience during my time here. I’ve decided to pursue another opportunity that aligns with my long-term goals.

Please let me know how I can help with the transition. I’m committed to making this process as smooth as possible.

Thank you again for the opportunity.

Sincerely,
Zahid Anwar
