Subject: RE: Follow-up Regarding Office Attendance Request

Dear Tim,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on my previous message regarding the office attendance schedule and share some additional context about my situation that I hope will help explain my request for an exception.

My son requires regular therapy sessions, which have become increasingly demanding on our schedule. As his primary caregiver, I need to be present for these crucial therapeutic interventions, which occur multiple times per week. The current situation has become particularly challenging as I try to balance these essential medical appointments with office presence requirements.

The therapy schedule is quite rigid, and finding alternative care arrangements has proven extremely difficult, especially given the specialized nature of his care needs. When I'm required to be in the office, it means either missing these vital therapy sessions or trying to reschedule them, which can result in significant setbacks in his progress and development.

I want to emphasize that I remain deeply committed to my role and responsibilities. During remote work days, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to:
- Maintain high productivity levels
- Be fully available during business hours
- Actively participate in all team meetings and collaborations
- Complete all assignments on or ahead of schedule
- Provide immediate response to any urgent matters

If granted this exception for reduced office presence, I would:
- Ensure my monthly in-office days align with key team meetings and activities
- Provide a regular schedule of my in-office days well in advance
- Be flexible in adjusting my in-office days when critical in-person meetings arise
- Continue to maintain strong virtual presence and communication

I understand this is a significant request, but I am going through a particularly challenging period, and your support would make a tremendous difference in helping me manage both my professional responsibilities and my son's essential care needs.

I'm happy to discuss this further or provide any additional information that would be helpful in considering my request. Thank you for taking the time to understand my situation.

Best regards,
Zahid
