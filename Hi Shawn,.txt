Hi Shawn,

Thank you for considering my request and being open to discussion. When I joined the team, I accepted the position with the understanding it would be fully remote, as this arrangement was crucial given my family situation. While I understand that government regulations have changed since then, my family circumstances continue to require significant flexibility.

Given my family caregiving responsibilities and the lengthy 47-mile commute, I would be able to come to the office once per month. This would allow me to:
- Maintain meaningful in-person connections with the team
- Participate in crucial face-to-face meetings
- Better balance my family's needs with work responsibilities
- Plan ahead for arranging alternative care coverage

I remain fully committed to my role and would ensure that my limited office presence doesn't impact my productivity or team collaboration. On remote days, I'll continue to be fully available during business hours and maintain strong communication with the team.

Would it be possible to consider this monthly in-office arrangement? I'm happy to discuss this further and find a solution that works for everyone.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,
Zahid
